### About me
I'm just a hobby programmer with a keen interest in procedural generation.
### Languages
#### C
I prefer plain C for my little projects. In the future, I probably will start learning C++.
#### Scripting
I also got into scripting languages such as Bash and Powershell, because automatisation is the way to go. ðŸ˜‰
### Environment
I started out on Windows, nowadays I mostly use Linux. Vim is my preferred editor.
