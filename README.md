### About me
I'm just a hobby programmer.
### Projects
#### C
I'm especially interested in pseudo random number generation, and procedural generation respectively.
I prefer plain C for my little projects.
#### Scripting
I also show some interest in scripting languages such as Bash and Powershell, because automatisation is the way to go. ðŸ˜‰
### Environment
I started out on Windows, nowadays I mostly use Linux. Vim is my preferred editor.
