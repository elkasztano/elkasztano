### About me
I'm just a hobby programmer with a keen interest in procedural generation and automatisation.
### Languages
#### Rust
I recently came across the Rust programming languange, which is awesome. Rust also comes in handy on SBCs like the Raspberry Pi.
#### C
In the early days I used to prefer plain C for my little projects.
#### Scripting
I also got into scripting languages such as Bash and Powershell. Things should be running as autonomously as possible. ðŸ˜‰
### Environment
I started out on Windows, nowadays I mostly use Linux. Vim is my preferred editor.
I'm also a bit of a tinkerer, and I like working with SBCs like the Raspberry Pi and/or microcontrollers such as the Arduino.
